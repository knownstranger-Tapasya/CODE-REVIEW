❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() { return a + b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add variables `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function's scope or
passed as arguments.
* ❌ The function lacks input validation and could lead to unexpected results if `a` or `b` are not numbers.
* ❌ The function does not indicate what happens if one or both variables are not defined, which could lead to errors.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
return "Error: Both arguments must be numbers.";
}
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ The function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are meant to be added together.
* ✔ Input validation is added to ensure that both `a` and `b` are numbers. If not, the function returns an error
message.
* ✔ The function now provides a useful error message if the inputs are invalid, improving its robustness.

Final Note:
The primary goal here is to ensure that the function is both functional and robust by explicitly defining its inputs and
validating them. This version provides a more reliable and understandable way to perform addition in JavaScript.
